# Students

Just a simple application made in Scala.

# Requirements

# Evaluation

The good:

* It's compatible with Java so you can use existing stuff.
  
The bad:

* You can not use scala within Java; it's like an oil stain that get bigger. Getting rid of scala is difficult.
* Splitting the code into multiple files REQUIRES maven/sbt/amorite whatever
* SBT sucks enormously
* 
The ugly:

* Since scala 3 they now use the "Python way" -> indentation determines the control flow
